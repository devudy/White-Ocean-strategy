# White-Ocean-strategy

In this essay, we have discussed the concepts of all the 5 ocean strategies with the leadership required for it, the detailed research on all the strategies gave us a good overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these oceans. The limitation that we have observed allowed us to devise a new ocean strategy which we named as white ocean strategy. To ensure the success of any organization different strategies are used to complete the objective, incase once the strategy is not enough we can cocktail multiple strategies and that is what white ocean strategy advocates. just like a rainbow which consists of all other light colors white ocean is also a mixture of all colored oceans. Just like the red ocean white ocean also talks about the competitiveness in the market space, it also talks about innovations like the blue ocean, it addresses environmental concerns like the green ocean, survival like the purple ocean, and also the profits. This strategy is considered an optimal solution-providing strategy that can ensure the success of the company.
